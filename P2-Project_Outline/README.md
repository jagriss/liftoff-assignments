# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am proposing a program that will act as a crowdsourced application for tracking covid-19 among family and friends. The app will allow people to "check-in" when they attend an event/party/gathering either entering the location manually or potentially using geolocations on photos. If, in the event that someone who attended this event tests positive or is exposed prior to the event they update their status and everyone who was there is notified. 
### Features
Login: to ensure the privacy and security of people using the application there will be private accounts.
Create "post" or add location: users will be able to add locations and details about an event that will link to other attendees.
Search: Users will be able to search past events and attendees within the database. 
Mapping: There will be a visual geographical feature to represent the spread of the virus among people you come into contact with.
### Technologies
-Java
-SpringBoot
-Hibernate
-JavaScript
-HTML/CSS
### What I'll Have to Learn
I am not sure of the exact technology I will need to learn to solve this issue but I will need to develop some understanding of using and representing a geographic landscape in my application. Whether that requires an API or some new language I am not sure but I believe that a visual representation is much more powerful and interactive for the user. Adding this feature will allow users to see where they have been and where there contacts have been.
